## Health_Insurance_Price_Prediction



## 🎯 Project Objective


 The objective of this project is to predict the price of health insurance based on key factors such as Region, Sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.
## 📊 2. Dataset


Source: 🌐 Opendatabay (Public Domain – CC0)

Size: ~2,700 records 📑

Features: 7 columns (including region, sex, BMI, children, smoker, etc.)

✅ The dataset is clean and well-structured, making it suitable for machine learning tasks.
## 🛠️Tools & Libraries Used

Tools:

💻 Google Colab

🖥️ VS Code

Libraries:

🐼 pandas

🔢 numpy

🤖 scikit-learn

🌐 streamlit
## ⚙️ Methodology

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Applied basic cleaning

Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (region, sex, smoker)


🤖 Model Building

Trained a regression model on the dataset

Predicted health insurance prices based on input features


🚀 Deployment

Created a simple Streamlit web app to make predictions interactively


## 📈Results

The trained model achieved an R² score of 75% ✅

📊 This indicates a reasonably good fit for this mini-project.



## 🏆 Conclusion

Through this project, I learned:

📘 How supervised machine learning models work in practice

🧩 How to preprocess data using encoding techniques

🌍 How to deploy a ML model as a web application using Streamlit

✨ This project gave me practical experience and confidence in applying machine learning to real-world problems.
🧩 How to preprocess data using encoding techniques

As this is my mini Project, in future I ready to do more in bigger level.
Thanks.
